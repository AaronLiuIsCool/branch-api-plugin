<div>
    Indicates that the branch contains code changes from authors who do not otherwise have the write access
    to the repository.

    <p>
    Such code can contain malicious changes, so this flag serves as a signal to allow other plugins in Jenkins to
    set up a higher degree of isolation to protect the build infrastructure, as well as disabling activities
    with side-effect, such as deploying to a server.

    <p>
    Some examples of where the trusted vs non-trusted distinction becomes important:

<ul>
<li>
    Github pull requests should be non-trusted as they can be created by <em>any</em> user</li>
<li>
    A Subversion branching structure such as <tt>trunk, branches, tags, sandbox</tt> would probably have
    <tt>trunk, branches, tags</tt> as trusted and <tt> sandbox</tt> as untrusted where the Subversion permissions
    give any authenticated user write access to <tt>sandbox</tt> but allow the project team to commit to all four
    locations
<li>
    In a closed source code development where only employees and contractors work on the code,
    no branch needs to be marked as non-trusted because every commit comes from a known set of people.
</ul>
